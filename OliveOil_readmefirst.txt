Raw data presented in excel files:
1. Database_SampleInformation.xls : relaxometry measures (NMR-based traits) and 
sample information (types and origins of Olive Oils as disclosed by the manufacturer);
2. OliveOil_Type.xls : relaxometry measures (NMR-based traits) by olive oil type (EVOO, VOO or refined OO) versus state of the art technologies (UV-VIS and NIRS spectra);
3. OliveOil_Region.xls : relaxometry measures (NMR-based traits) by olive oil region of origin (Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal) versus state of the art technologies (UV-VIS and NIRS spectra);
4. OliveOil_LOD.xls : relaxometry measures (NMR-based traits) of adulterated Olive oil (sunflower mixed with olive oil) versus state of the art technologies (UV-VIS and NIRS intentsity at 670nm peak);
